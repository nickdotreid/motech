===================================

`Issue Tracker <https://applab.atlassian.net/browse/MOTECH/fixforversion/15741/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:version-issues-panel>`_

Stable Semantic Versioning
--------------------------
We will apply the `open semantic version scheme <http://semver.org/>`_ to the MOTECH Platform and all modules thus making it easier to determine backward compatibility. We will stabilize our core system and API providing implementers with a level of confidence that their system will be compatible with future releases of MOTECH. (`MOTECH-585 <https://applab.atlassian.net/browse/MOTECH-585>`_)

Platform and Module API Standardization and Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------
Every public API will be standardized and documented with standard javadoc that is published with each release. (`MOTECH-1466 <https://applab.atlassian.net/browse/MOTECH-1466>`_)

Consistent User Interface Elements
------------------------------------
Developers across the globe have contributed UI code to MOTECH. We will make UI elements consistent across the platform to ease implementation and prepare for UI improvements after the MOTECH 1.0 release. (`MOTECH-2008 <https://applab.atlassian.net/browse/MOTECH-2008>`_)

Standardized Interoperability
-----------------------------
We are working to integrate MOTECH with the `Open eHealth Integration platform <http://80.86.91.51/display/ipf2/Home>`_, opening up new standardized workflows that support the majority of IHE profiles and, therefore, OpenHIE workflows.(`MOTECH-1242 <https://applab.atlassian.net/browse/MOTECH-1242>`_)

Post 1.0 - Release date: TBD
============================
We are currently focusing on our MOTECH 1.0 release and will reevaluate the post 1.0 issues at a later time. Below are our issue trackers for Post 1.0
